I tried to reduce the clipping in this model as much as I could, but if you have issues with skin clipping though the dress the stomach area, you can try using the "Clipping" morph.
Just remember to turn it off when removing the clothes, since it deforms the body underneath.

If you think you can help improve this model in any way feel free to message me.
