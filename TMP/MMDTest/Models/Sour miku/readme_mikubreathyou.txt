panties: remap UV and recolor to fit red-black color scheme
re-add red color to stockings
re-add 01 on arm
fix right wrist clipping thru ribbon
add skirt parent and skirt ik
add shoes-off morph, feet-flat morph, barefoot-height morph
add many many more clothes removal morphs
improve shirt weights
add pubic hair (Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ style)
add english translation for materials/bones/morphs
remove unused bones
reweight skirt to upper/lower body
fix bad weights all over skirt & leg
fix alignment of foot bows
organize eye HL morphs in a way that actually makes sense
add AutoLuminous morphs




NOTES:
"Top cut" only looks good if the bare boobs are used, and they are reduced. but "porori + cut" does not need the boobs reduced. all of this is already handled by the group morphs. 
morph なぬ！/"nanu" was Google Translated to "Unexpected it!" but i honestly have no idea what this morph is supposed to be/show
various materials had reflection=100.5 or reflection=103, i replaced this with AL (AutoLuminous) morphs, and also doubled the max strength to 101 or 106
socks red A is the original outfit, socks red B is shifted higher so it's less red overall
the "bra" desn't look very good because you are not supposed to see it directly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ its just so skin doesn't clip thru the top
